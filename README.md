## Wtvr3d Editor

:warning: **This is very very WIP** :warning:

An editor for the [Wtvr3d](https://github.com/wtvr-engine/wtvr3d) Engine for importing, testing and configuring assets, before using them in the engine itself.

Functionnality might be extended in the future.

The main goal right now is:

 - [ ] Importing and setting up materials
 - [ ] Importing Meshes
 - [ ] Testing Meshes and materials together in real time
 - [ ] Easily generate JSON configuration and file structure for linking Meshes, Materials and Textures.

## Tools

This project uses [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/) to create a user-friendly editor for [Wtvr3d](https://github.com/wtvr-engine/wtvr3d).
